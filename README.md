# fundamental_of_computer_science
Although I'm somewhat proficient in infrastructure and programming, I have never taken fundamental of computer science courses in college. This is the list of TODO to complete the fundamental of computer science.

- [ ] Cryptography
  - [ ] 1: https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto
  - [ ] 2(Advanced): https://www.udacity.com/course/applied-cryptography--cs387
- [ ] Data Structure/Algorithm
  - Learn about fundamental data types (stack, queues, and bags), sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort), data structures (binary search trees, red-black trees, hash tables), and Big O.
  - [ ] 1: https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI

- [x] Math
  - [x] Linear Algebra
    - I marked this, because I assumed I have enough knowledge and experience by completing CS229 in Stanford
    - Supplemental: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra
  - Multi Variable Calculus: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus
    - For now, probably I won't need it. 
- [ ] AI/機械学習
  - [x] https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229
  - [ ] IF I needed: https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009
- オブジェクト指向でのコードの書き方
- テストの書き方
- OS
- [x] Android App Dev
  - I released 2 apps and one library so, yeah...
- [ ] [Web Dev](Google Developer Training for Web)
